This project demonstrates how to change the hair color in an image using OpenCV. The script allows you to select and modify the hair region in an image and apply a new color to it. It uses various image processing techniques such as color segmentation, thresholding, and region detection to isolate the hair and replace its color dynamically.

## Features

- Detects hair regions automatically using image segmentation techniques.
- Allows you to change the hair color to any desired shade.
- Simple command-line interface to upload and edit images.
- Supports multiple image formats.
